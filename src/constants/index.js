  shortDescription:
    "A full-stack digital learning platform to modernize training in the maritime sector, replacing traditional TeamViewer sessions with a user-friendly online system.",
  longDescription: [
    "In collaboration with Periskal and AP Hogeschool, my team and I developed Periskal Academy, a comprehensive full-stack digital learning platform. Its primary goal was to modernize and streamline training in the maritime sector. Our solution replaces outdated traditional TeamViewer sessions, offering a user-friendly online system for self-paced training modules, integrated exams, and efficient certification processes.",
    "This project was a true full-stack endeavor, encompassing everything from database design and implementation to the user interface. We handled robust backend logic, efficient data management, and ensured a smooth, intuitive user experience. The collaboration aspect, working closely with industry partners and educational institutions, provided invaluable real-world project experience.",
    "Our core tech stack for Periskal Academy included Angular and Bulma for a responsive and modern frontend, providing a dynamic and engaging learning environment. For the backend, we utilized Java Spring Boot, ensuring a powerful, secure, and scalable foundation for the platform's functionalities. This combination allowed us to build a robust system capable of handling complex training workflows and user data effectively.",
    "Working on Periskal Academy was an incredible learning journey, offering deep insights into end-to-end development and the intricacies of bringing a large-scale application to life within a collaborative team setting. A huge shout-out to my teammates Mansur Sulejmanov, Matti Langbeen, and Adam Bakhmadov for their contributions as full-stack developers on this project. All data shown in screenshots is for testing purposes.",
